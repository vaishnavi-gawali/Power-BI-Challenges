I'm a [Power BI Certified Data Analyst](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/vaishnaviavinashgawali-1499/credentials/f6de94eefdcd5dd0?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2F), and I'm currently working on enhancing my skills by tackling the [Workout Wednesday Challenges](https://workout-wednesday.com/power-bi-challenges/). These challenges are a great way to dive deeper into Power BI and refine my expertise. I’ll be sharing the .pbix files for all the challenges I've completed right here. 

Please feel free to explore and learn from them. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out—I’m always up for a discussion on Power BI and data analysis!
