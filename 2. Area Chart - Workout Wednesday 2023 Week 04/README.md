# Workout Wednesday 2023 Week 04

In this challenge, I used the Mortgage Rates dataset to create an area chart displaying 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates on a single axis. I calculated the difference between these rates and visualized it using DAX functions, while also ensuring consistent color formatting and appropriate text and titles.
