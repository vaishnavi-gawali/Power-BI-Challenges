# Workout Wednesday 2023 Week 23

The first challenge I chose focused on Power BI core visuals. It involved creating a stacked column chart, a clustered column chart, and a Tree Map — essential visuals of Power BI. This exercise provided me with hands-on experience in leveraging sorting functionality and refining formatting options to enhance data presentation.
